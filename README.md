Assignment

Create a simple server using the core ‘node:http’ module that can handle multiple concurrent requests. Each request should respond with a message after a random delay (simulating some asynchronous operation) without blocking the server.
 

The server should be configured to handle CORS.
Provide a GET route that when hit, returns information about the user’s CPU and OS (any information you’d like to return).
